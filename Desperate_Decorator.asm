; The drawing of the drips is driven by a number of tables:
;
; There are 256 drips of paint: the leftmost (drip #0) is at pixel column #32,
; the rightmost (drip #255) is at pixel column 32+255 = #287:
; All the drips start at pixel row #0, therefore the byte containing
; the initial pixel of a drip is given by the following formula:
;
; 8192 + 32 + 8 * (num_drip / 8)
; \__/  \__/  \________________/
;  |     |            |
;  |     |            +------ horizontal offset
;  |     |
;  |     +------ pixel column of drip #0  \
;  |                                      +--- base address of playfield's row #0
;  +------ base address of hi-res screen  /
;
; Drips #0-#7 begin at byte 8224 ($2020), drips #8-#15 begin at byte 8232 ($2028)
; and so on, up to drips #248-#255 beginning at byte 8472 ($2118).
; The formula is not computed directly: rather a 256 bytes table is used:
; entering with num_drip it returns the horizontal offset (H_OFFSET).
;
; Once the horizontal offset is known, the byte containing the tail end
; (or any other point in between, for what it matters) can easily be calculated
; changing the base address according to the desired vertical position.
;
; As known, the address of each row of C64's hires screen is laid out this way:
;
; Row #0:  base address of hi-res screen
; Row #1:  base address + 1
; ...
; Row #7:  base address + 7
; Row #8:  base address + 64
; ...
; Row #15: base address + 71
; Row #16: base address + 128, and so on...
;
; The base address of any vertical position along a drip is given by the following
; formula:
;
; 8192 + 32 + 256 * (drip_vpos / 8) + 64 * (drip_vpos / 8) + (drip_vpos % 8)
; \__/  \__/  \____________________________________________________________/

;  |     |
;  |     +------ pixel column of drip #0  \
;  |                                      +--- base address of playfield's row #0
;  +------ base address of hi-res screen  /
;
; Again, the formula is not computed directly: rather the full base address,
; not just the vertical offset, is computed using two tables, each giving the low
; and the high byte of the result when entering with drip_vpos (the result is greater
; than 255 so we need two tables DRIP_TAIL_BASE_LO and _HI).
;
; Once these quantities are known, any byte on the playfield is accessible:
; to access single pixels two more formulas are needed.
;
; The first formula computes which bit in the bye corresponds to particular drip:
;
; num_drip % 8 --- DRIP_TO_BITMASK
;
; and the second one to compute the OR-mask needed to set that pixel:
;
; 2 ^ (7 - DRIP_TO_BITMASK) --- BITMASK
;
; Two tables are used because only the first is necessary if you need to iterate drips.
;
; Finally, the current length of each drip is stored in another table
; which is filled with $00 at the beginning of a new game (DRIP_LENGTH).
