# The Story So Far...

Getting drips of paint on the carpet is one of the nightmares of the do-it-yourself decorator. In this game we give you the opportunity to improve your drip-stopping technique without the damage.

The aim of the game is to prevent the runs of paint dripping down the screen (the wall) and reaching the carpet, using your paint roller. You control the position of the 'roller' graphic on screen, using the keyboard.

# Commands

Use 'SHIFT', 'COMMODORE', ';' and '/' keys to move the roller and wipe the dripping paint. Good luck, and don't waste your persian rug!
